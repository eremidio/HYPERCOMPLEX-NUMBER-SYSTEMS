# HYPERCOMPLEX-NUMBER-SYSTEMS
A SIMPLES IMPLEMENTATION OF HYPERCOMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEMS IN C++.

HYPERCOMPLEX SYSTEMS ARE VECTOR SPACES OVER A FIELD THAT ARE ALSO ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS, I.E., THERE'S A WELL DEFINED
OPERATION OF MULTIPLICATION AMONG THE  BASIS VECTORS. THE HYPERCOMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEMS PROVIDES USEFUL EXTENSIONS OF THE
FIELD OF REAL NUMBERS. SEVERAL HYPERCOMPLEX SYSTEMS CAN BE DEFINED BY TAKING AN APPROPRIATE RULE OF MULTIPLICATION FOR A
GIVEN DIMENSION.


THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES ARE THE COMPLEX NUMBERS AND THE QUATERNIONS WHICH FIND MANY APPLICATIONS IN PHYSICS, 
CHEMISTRY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS ITSELF. C++ HAS ALREADY A LIBRARY AVAILABLE FOR COMPLEX NUMBERS IN THE STL.
